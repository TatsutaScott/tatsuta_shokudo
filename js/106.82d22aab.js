Add the fresh and canned tomatoes, red pepper flakes, and season lightly with the salt and pepper. Cook tomatoes for a few minutes so soften. Crush tomatoes in the pan using a potato masher. Continue cooking until tomatoes are tender and sauce has thickened, 20 to 25 minutes.","note":"I always start with a light hand with the salt and pepper because as the tomatoes reduce, the salt will become concentrated."},{"step":"Taste and season lightly with salt again, keeping in mind the pasta will be plenty salty.

Refrigerate it for up to two days or freeze it for longer storage."},"While the tomatoes are cooking, make the basil-garlic oil.

","note":"If the sauce seems too thick, add a little pasta cooking liquid to adjust it."},{"step":"Remove pan from the heat and toss the butter, basil and cheese with the pasta in the same manner.

Keep the heat on low to allow the ingredients to warm slowly and release their flavors. Turn heat off and let cool for 10 minutes. The longer you let the oil sit, the more infused the oil. Strain the oil, discarding the solids."]}]}')}}]);
