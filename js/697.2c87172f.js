Heat oil in a Dutch oven or other large heavy ovenproof pot over medium. Cook **garlic**, stirring often, until golden, about** 4 minutes**. Add **onion**, **anchovies** (if using), and **red pepper flakes** and cook, stirring often, until onion is translucent, about **5 minutes**. Stir in tomato paste and cook, stirring often, until slightly darkened, about **2 minutes**. Add **wine**, bring to a boil, and cook until almost completely evaporated, about **1 minute**. Add **tomatoes**, breaking up with your hands, and their juices; add **basil** and **oregano** and stir to combine. Swirl **1½ cups water** into one tomato can, then the other, to rinse, and add to pot; season with **salt**. Transfer pot to oven; roast sauce, stirring halfway through, until thick and tomatoes are browned on top and around edges of pot, **2–2½ hours**.","Let sauce cool slightly. Pass through the large holes of a food mill or process in a food processor until mostly smooth. Taste and season with salt."]},{"title":"Slow Cooker Version","steps":["Lightly season **eggplant slices** all over with salt; place in a single layer on several layers of paper towels inside a rimmed baking sheet. Top with another layer of paper towels and more slices; repeat as needed. Top with a final layer of paper towels, then another rimmed baking sheet; weigh down with a heavy pot. Let eggplant sit until it has released excess liquid, **45–60 minutes**. This step gives the eggplant a creamy texture when baked.","Meanwhile, pulse **panko**, **oregano**, **pepper**, and **¾ cup Parmesan** in a food processor until very finely ground. Transfer to a shallow bowl.","Preheat oven to **350°**. Place **flour** in another shallow bowl and **eggs** in a third shallow bowl. Working one at a time, dredge eggplant slices in flour, then dip in egg, allowing excess to drip off. Coat in **breadcrumbs**, packing all around, then shaking off excess. Place on wire racks.","Heat **⅔ cup oil** in a large skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium-high. Cook as many eggplant slices as will comfortably fit in pan, turning once, until deep golden, about **5 minutes**. Transfer to paper towels and immediately press with more paper towel to absorb oil. Working in batches, repeat with remaining slices, adding remaining **⅔ cup oi**l and wiping out skillet as needed. Let cool. Taste and season with more salt if needed.","Toss **chopped herbs**, **low-moisture mozzarella**, and remaining **¾ cup Parmesan** in a medium bowl. Spread **1 cup sauce** over the bottom of a **13x9\\" baking pan**; top with a layer of eggplant slices (*trim as needed*). Drizzle **1 cup sauce** over and sprinkle with **one-third of cheese mixture**. Add another layer of eggplant, followed by 1 cup sauce and half of remaining cheese mixture. Repeat layers with remaining slices, sauce, and cheese mixture. Cover with foil and bake on a rimmed baking sheet until eggplant is custardy, **45–60 minutes**.","Remove from oven and arrange **fresh mozzarella** over eggplant. Increase oven temperature to **425°** and bake, uncovered, until cheese is bubbling and browned in spots, **15–20 minutes longer**. Let rest **30 minutes**.
