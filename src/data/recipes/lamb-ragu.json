        "Season the **lamb neck** liberally with **salt** and **pepper**. Heat the oil in a large heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium high-heat. Sear the lamb until well browned on all sides. Remove to a platter and set aside.",
        "Reduce the heat to medium. Add the **onion**, **carrot**, and **celery** and saut√© until softened but not browned, about **8 minutes**. Add the **garlic** and continue to cook until aromatic, about **1 minute**. Add the **tomato paste** and cook, stirring often, until the paste becomes a rich dark red, about **3 minutes**.",
        "Deglaze the pot by adding the **red wine**, scraping up all the browned bits. Add the **broth**, **tomatoes**, **thyme**, **rosemary**, and **bay leaf** and stir to combine. Bring the mixture just to a boil and reduce the heat to low. Return the **lamb** and any drippings to the pot, nestling the pieces into the liquid until mostly covered. Cover securely and simmer for **2 to 3 hours**, turning the lamb **once per hour** or until the lamb is tender and falling off the bone.",
        "Remove the lamb to a platter and let it cool slightly. Using two forks or your fingers shred the lamb from the bones into bite-sized pieces. Remove the thyme, rosemary, and bay leaf and discard.",
        "In a small saucepan bring the **milk** just to a simmer. Gradually add the milk to the sauce, a small amount at a time, stirring regularly. Return the lid to the pot, leaving slightly askew, and allow the mixture to simmer until the milk is well integrated, about **30 minutes**. Return the lamb and any drippings to the pot, stir well to combine, and return just to a boil. (*If the sauce seems too watery for your taste, lower the heat and simmer until adequately reduced.*)",
        "Serve over freshly cooked pasta or polenta, garnished with **fresh parsley**."
